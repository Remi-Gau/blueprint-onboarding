3. We post our papers as preprints.
4. We value contributions to the commons (software, etc.)
5. We discuss unpublished research online in a way that is discoverable.
6. We develop software and analyses in the open.
7. We post unpublished data with full metadata.
8. We encourage and acknowledge external interactions with & contributions to our research products.
9. We provide a controlled and moderated space for discussions around our research.
10. We advocate for and value these principles when reviewing papers, grants, and promotion packets.
