Meta-Guidelines for Onboarding Document
===============

 * Simple: Use straightforward language and avoid jargon.
 * Concise: The document should be readable in a single sitting.
 * Specific: It should be targeted to the lab in question.
 * Enforceable: Failure to meet expectations should have consequences.
 * Living: The document is expected to change.

 * Local Resources: (should this be part of a separate document?)
