Communication
=============

Venue: Where do we communicate?  Is it required?  Ephemeral, archived, etc.

Detail Level: How often should lab members communicate with the PI, and what
level of detail is expected in those communications?  Are there guidelines for
what types of problems to immediately escalate to the PI?

Project: What standards of communication should there be for interfacing
between projects (which may have external contributors and participants) and
lab members?  For instance, is it acceptable etiquette to say, "I will come by
your office and work through this with you"?  Can external project participants
influence development conducted by lab members?  Does all software development
need to be immediately upstreamed, or are there patterns for submitting
development?
