Expectations
============

Code of Conduct: What rules are all lab members expected to follow?

Authorship: How do we confer authorship?  What constitutes collaboration or
work on a paper that results in authorship?

Project Ownership: When a project is developed in the lab, how does that
project (from a social, rather than licensing/IP/technical perspective) grow or
change if the primary developer leaves the lab?

Project Leadership: When software development is funded, how is the leadership
direction established for projects developed in the lab?  Is there a
consensus-based approach, is there a strategy for governance, does it include
external participants?  How is leadership broken down between technical and
social?

Ethics: How do we decide what is right and wrong / who lives and who dies, and
how do we influence our decisions about projects, interactions, and scientific
actions based on these ethics?  This concerns things like scooping, being
worried about scooping, actions with respect to software and data as it
concerns "competitor" groups.  When developing software, how are citations to
other pieces of software handled?  When writing papers, how are citations
handled?
